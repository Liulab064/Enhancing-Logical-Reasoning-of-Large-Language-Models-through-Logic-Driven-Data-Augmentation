However, this characteristic is actually quite common. Certain species of plankton, for example, generate a gas that is converted in the atmosphere into particles of sulfate. These particles cause water vapor to condense, thus forming clouds. Indeed, the formation of clouds over the ocean largely depends on the presence of these particles.

The authority plans to finance these improvements over the course of five years by raising automobile tolls on the two highway bridges along the route the rail line serves. Although the proposed improvements are indeed needed, the authority' s plan for securing the necessary funds should be rejected because it would unfairly force drivers to absorb the entire cost of something from which they receive no benefit. Question: Which of the following, if true, would cast the most doubt on the effectiveness of the authority's plan to finance the proposed improvements by increasing bridge tolls? \nA. A.

Knowingly making a false claim is unethical if those making it derive a gain at the expense of those acting as if the claim were true. \nC. C.

In the blood of over half of the dolphins, marine biologists discovered a brevotoxin that had been emitted by the alga Ptychodiscus brevis, in what is known as a red tide. Additionally, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), a toxic industrial compound, was also found in the dolphin's blood. A reasonable conclusion, and indeed one many have drawn, is that the dolphins were simply victims of the brevotoxin. Nonetheless, brevotoxins, by themselves, are not lethal to dolphins, though they do tax the dolphins system. Furthermore, most dolphins have some accumulated brevotoxins in their blood without suffering any ill health effects. Ttherefore, the brevotoxins alone cannot explain the mass beaching of dead dolphins. Question: Which of the following, if true, does most to help explain the oceanologist's doubt that the brevotoxins were the primary cause of the dolphins washing upon shore? \nA. A. While PCB can cause metabolic imbalances in dolphins so that they stop eating prematurely, the dose of PCB a dolphin encounters in the wild is unlikely to pose a lethal threat to a dolphin. \nB. B. Shortly before the dolphins washed ashore, a major oil spill not only caused algae to release brevotoxins but also released an array of deleterious industrial pollutants, including PCB. \nC. C.

At low altitudes, where atmospheric pressure is high, this effect is best produced by a short nozzle, but when the rocket passes through the thin upper atmosphere, a long nozzle becomes more effective. Thus, to work most effectively throughout their ascents, all rockets must have both short nozzles and long nozzles on their engines. Question: Which one of the following is an assumption the argument requires? \nA. A. For a rocket to work most effectively at both low and high atmospheric pressures, it must have at least one engine that has both a short nozzle and a long nozzle. \nB. B. For a rocket to work effectively, its engines' exhaust gases must leave the nozzles at the same pressure as the surrounding atmosphere throughout the rocket's ascent. \nC. C.

Voter turnout is at a record low, particularly for local elections. Some municipal elections have less than thirty percent voter participation. Congressional approval ratings have not surpassed 30 percent since 2009, but incumbents win reelection campaigns at a rate of 90 percent. Rank choice voting is the answer. Under this system, voters rank candidates in order of choice, and when their preferred candidate is eliminated in an instantaneous runoff, their vote is transferred to their next most-preferred candidate. As a result, voter participation will increase, since there will be more candidates and competition, leading to more effective representation.

Angiosperms, a certain class of plants, first appeared at the time that dinosaurs became extinct. These plants produce amino-acid-based alkaloids that are psychoactive agents. Most plant-eating mammals avoid these potentially lethal poisons because they taste bitter. Moreover, mammals have livers that help detoxify such drugs. However, dinosaurs could neither taste the bitterness nor detoxify the substance once it was ingested. This theory receives its strongest support from the fact that it helps explain why so many dinosaur fossils are found in unusual and contorted positions.

This is not a problem in well-ventilated houses, but it is a problem in houses that are so well insulated that they trap toxins as well as heat. Recent tests, however, demonstrate that houseplants remove some household toxins from the air and thereby eliminate their danger. In one test, 20 large plants eliminated formaldehyde from a small, well-insulated house. Question: The passage is structured to lead to which one of the following conclusions? \nA. A. Keeping houseplants is an effective means of trapping heat in a poorly insulated house. \nB. B. Keeping houseplants can compensate for some of the negative effects of poor ventilation. \nC. C. Nonsynthetic products do not release toxins into houses. \nD. D. The air in a well-insulated house with houseplants will contain fewer toxins than the air in a well-ventilated house without houseplants. \nAnswer: "}], "question_type": 6, "id_string": "test_994"}
